# School_District_Analysis

## Resources
Using Python 3.7 for Module 4

## Background
We had a new version of the student data with several changes including an added column for 'Student Budget'. We needed to rework our analysis with the new dataset.

## Summary
### Deliverable 1
*Collect the student data into a DataFrame. 
First we need to import the required libraries and dependencies. I've additionally included an ignore function for filter warnings.

To collect the data, we need to use Pandas read_csv and os.path.join functions to import the data from the new_student_data.csv file, and create a DataFrame called student_df.

*Prepare a cleaned version of the DataFrame.
*Summarize key pieces of data
*Drill down into the data to analyze the specific subsets
